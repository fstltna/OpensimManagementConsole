Edit "omc" and change the settings at the top if your Opensim server is not in "/root/opensim".

You will need to run cpan and install these modules:

- UI::Dialog
- Term::ReadKey
- Term::ANSIScreen

You also need to have my Opensim Startup Script and Opensim Backup Script installed.

I then suggest you add this directory (OpensimManagementConsole) into your path, so that you can just run "git pull" to upgrade to the latest version as updates come out.
